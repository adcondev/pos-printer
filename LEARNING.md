## Project Overview

This repository contains a modular and extensible Go library designed for communicating with Point of Sale (POS) thermal printers. The library provides a unified interface to support various printer models and protocols, making it a versatile solution for receipt and label printing. Its architecture is built to be clean and modular, with each printer capability separated into its own package for maximum maintainability and reliability. The project also includes a centralized registry system for managing multiple printer configurations, making it suitable for production environments.

## Tech Stack and Key Technologies

*   **Language:** Go (Golang)
*   **Protocols:** ESC/POS, ZPL (Zebra Programming Language)
*   **Connection Types:** Serial, USB, Network, Bluetooth
*   **Build and Dependency Management:** Go Modules
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Notable Libraries

*   **`github.com/skip2/go-qrcode`:** Used for generating QR codes, which can be printed on receipts or labels. This library simplifies the process of creating QR codes from string data.
*   **`golang.org/x/image`:** A fundamental library for image manipulation in Go. It is used for handling bitmap generation from image files, a core feature for printing logos or other graphics.
*   **`golang.org/x/text`:** Provides tools for text encoding and internationalization. In this project, it is likely used to handle different character sets and ensure proper text rendering on various printer models.

## Major Achievements and Skills Demonstrated

*   **Designed a Modular, Extensible Go Library:** Developed a decoupled architecture where each printer protocol (ESC/POS, ZPL) and connection type (USB, Network) is implemented in its own isolated package.
*   **Implemented a Unified Interface for Multiple Protocols:** Created a consistent API that abstracts away the low-level details of different printer communication protocols.
*   **Developed a Centralized Printer Configuration Registry:** Built a system to manage multiple printer profiles, allowing for seamless switching between different hardware setups.
*   **Engineered Protocol-Agnostic Image Printing:** Implemented a feature to generate and print bitmaps from image files, compatible with any supported printer.
*   **Established a Comprehensive Testing Strategy:** Wrote unit tests with mocks and fakes to ensure the reliability and stability of the library in production.
*   **Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:** Automated the build, testing, and validation process to maintain code quality and streamline development.

## Skills Gained/Reinforced

*   **Go (Golang) Programming:** Advanced proficiency in Go, including interfaces, structs, and concurrent programming patterns.
*   **Software Architecture:** Designing modular and extensible systems with a clean, decoupled architecture.
*   **API Design:** Creating a unified and intuitive API to abstract complex underlying systems.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing comprehensive unit tests and using mocks/fakes to ensure code reliability.
*   **DevOps:** Implementing and managing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
*   **Hardware Communication:** Interfacing with external hardware (printers) using various connection protocols (Serial, USB, Network).
*   **Protocol Implementation:** Deep understanding of printer protocols like ESC/POS and ZPL.
